% solution 1
\text{}\\
The solutions for all the problems will use the master theorem, so I will just state it here. Let $a \geq 1, b > 1, c > 0$ and $d \geq 0$. If $T(n)$ satisfies the recurrence $T(n) = aT(n/b) + cn^d$.
% T(n) = {...
\[ T(x) = \begin{cases} 
   \Theta(n^{log_b{(a)}}) & a > b^d \\
   \Theta(n^dlog(n)) & a = b^d \\
   \Theta(n^d) & a < b^d 
\end{cases}
\]

\newpage

\begin{solution}
   \\
	(a) This algorithm can be rewritten as the recurrence: $A(n) = n^3 + 5A(\floor{n/2})$. Applying the master theorem, with $a = 5, b=2, c=1, d=3$. Since $5 < 2^3=8$, $T(n) = \Theta(n^3)$.
   \\\\
   (b) This algorithm can be rewritten as the recurrence: $B(n) = n^2 + 6B(\floor{n/4}) + 10B(\lceil{n/4}\rceil) = 16B(n/4) + n^2 \implies a=16, b=4, c=1, d=2$. From the master theorem, since $16=4^2$, $B(n) = \Theta(n^2\log(n))$.
   \\\\
   (c) This algorithm can be rewritten as the recurrence: $C(n) = 4C(\floor{n/3}) + n$. Applying the master theorem, with $a=4, b=3, c=1, d=1 \implies a > b^1 \implies C(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_3{4}})$.
   \\\\
   (d) This algorithm can be rewritten as the recurrence: $D(n) = 2 + 2D(n/5)$. The reason for the $2D(n/5)$ is because there even though there are four recursive calls in the code, only two are executed in any given iteration. Applying the master theorem, with $a=2,b=5,c=2,d=0 \implies a < b^d$, we have $B(n) = \Theta(n^{log_5(2)})$.
\end{solution}

% PROBLEM 2
\newpage
\vspace{0.1in}
\begin{problem}
We have three sets $A$, $B$, $C$ with the following properties:

\begin{description}

\item{(a)}  $|B| = 2|A|$, $|C| = 3|A|$, 


\item{(b)} $|A\cap B| = 18$,
        $|A\cap C| = 20$,
        $|B\cap C| = 24$,

\item{(c)}
$|A\cap B\cap C| = 11$,

\item{(d)}
$|A\cup B\cup C| = 129$.

\end{description}

\noindent Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to determine the number of elements in $A$. 
Show your work.
\end{problem}


%-----------------------------

\begin{solution}
	According to the inclusion exclusion principle, we have: \\ $|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$.
   \\
   We can substitute the values from (b), (c), (d) into the principle:
   \\
   $129 = |A| + |B| + |C| - 18 - 20 - 24 + 11 \implies |A| + |B| + |C| = 180$. To solve this, we want to put everything in terms of a single variable. From (a), we know the relationships between the three variables. I will choose to express everything in terms of $|A|$. Plugging this in, we get 
   \\ 
   $|A| +  2|A| + 3|A| = 180 \implies |A| = 30$. 
   \\ 
   From (a), we can find the rest of the values: $|B| = 60, |C| = 90$.

\end{solution}

% PROBLEM 3
\newpage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem}
	A company, Nice Inc., will award 45 fellowships to high-achieving UCR students from four different majors: computer science, biology, political science and history. They decided to give fellowship awards to at least 8 students majoring in computer science and at most 8 biology majors. The number of political science and history majors should be between 5 and 12 students each. How many possible lists of awardees are there? You need to give a complete derivation for the final answer, using the method developed in class. 
	(Brute force listing of all lists will not be accepted.)
	
\end{problem}
	

%----------------------------
% solution 3
\begin{solution}
   Let's say that the number of CS awards is C, biology is B, political science is P, history is H. We can express the conditions as:
   \\
   $
      C \geq 8 \\
      B \leq 8 \\
      5 \leq P, Q, \leq 12 \implies 0 \leq P', Q' \leq 7 \\
      C + B + P + H = 45
   $
   \\\\
   We can substitute $B' = B - 5$ and $P' = P - 5$ into the sum. Also, since C has no restrictions on the upper bound, we can kind of ignore it for now. We can now write:
   \\
   $B + P' + H' = 27$.
   \\\\
   We can also let the number of partitions that fit these conditions be the total number of partitions $(S())$ minus the number of invalid partitions:
   \\
   $
      S(B \leq 8 \wedge P'\leq 7 \wedge H' \leq 7) 
      \\= S() - S(B \geq 9 \lor P' \geq 8 \lor H' \geq 8)
   $.
   \\\\
   We know that the total number of partitions, 
   \\
   S() = ${m + k - 1 \choose k - 1}, m=27, k=4 \implies S() = {30 \choose 3} = 4060$.
   \\\\
   We can also calculate the number of invalid partitions using the inclusion-exclusion principle. Also that the number of partitions with conditions is ${m - A + k - 1 \choose k - 1}$, where A is the sum of the lower bounds.
   \\
   $
      S(B \geq 9 \lor P' \geq 8 \lor H' \geq 8) = 
      \\S(B \geq 9) + S(P' \geq 8) + S(H' \geq 8) \\
      - S(B \geq 9 \land P' \geq 8)
      - S(B \geq 9 \land P' \geq 8)
      - S(B \geq 8 \land P' \geq 8)\\
      + S(B \geq 9 \land P' \geq 8 \land H' \geq 8)
      \\\\={27 - 9 + 4 - 1 \choose 4 - 1} + 2{27 - 8 + 4 - 1 \choose 4 - 1}
      \\-2{27 - (9+8) + 4 - 1 \choose 4 - 1} - {27 - (8+8) + 4 - 1 \choose 4 - 1} - {27 - (9+8+8) + 4 - 1 \choose 4 - 1}
      \\=1330 + 1540 + 1540 - 286 - 286 - 364 + 10 = 3484
   $.
   \\
   Subtracting the total with the number of invalid partitions, we get $4060 - 3484 = 576$.
