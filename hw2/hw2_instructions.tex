\noindent  Prove the following statement: 


\noindent 
If $p > 5$ and $gcd(p, 20) = 1$,
then $(p^2 -21)(p^2 +16)\equiv 0 \pmod{20}$.

\emph{Hint:} 
The product of any $k$ consecutive integers is divisible by $k$.

\begin{problem}

\vspace{0.05in}
\noindent  Alice's RSA public key is $P = (e,n) = (7, 4453)$.
Bob sends Alice the message by encoding it as follows.
First he assigns numbers to characters:
A is 8, B is 9, ..., Z is 33, a blank is 34, quotation marks: 35, a coma:  36, a period: 37, an apostrophe: 38. Then he uses RSA to encode each number separately. 

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent Bob's encoded message is:

\begin{verbatim}

\noindent Decode Bob's message.
Notice that you only know Alice's public key, but don't know the private key. So you
need to "break" RSA to decrypt Bob's message. For the solution, you need to provide the following:
%
\begin{description}

	\item (a) Describe step by step how you 
	arrived at the solution: show how to find $p$ and $q$, $\phi(n)$ and $d$. 
	\item (b) Show your work for one integer in the message (M = 2218):  the expression, the decrypted integer, the character that it is mapped to.  
    \item (c) To decode the remaining numbers, you need to write a program in C++ (see below), test it in Gradescope, and append the code to HW 2, Problem 2 solutions.   
	\item (d) Give the decoded message (in integers).
	\item (e) Give Bob's message in
	plaintext. What does it mean and who said it?

\end{description}

\vspace{0.2in}
\noindent For part (c). Your program should :
\begin{description}

	\item (i) Take three integers, $e$, $n$ (the public key for RSA), and $m$ (the number of characters in the message) as input to your program. Next, input the ciphertext.
	\item (ii) Test whether the public key is valid. If not, output a single line ``Public key is not valid!'' and quit the program.
	\item (iv) If the public key is valid, decode the message.
	\item (v) Output $p$ and $q$, $\phi(n)$ and $d$.
	\item (vi) On a new line, output the decoded message in integers.
	\item (vii) On a new line, output the decoded message in English. The characters should be all uppercase. You can assume that the numbers will be assigned to characters according to the mapping above.
 
\end{description}

\noindent More information and specifications will be provided separately.

\vspace{0.2in}
\noindent Upload your code to Gradescope to test. There will be 15-16 (open and hidden) test cases.  Your score for the RSA code will be based on the score that you received in Gradescope. If you have any questions, post them on Slack.

\end{problem}



\paragraph{Academic integrity declaration.}
The homework papers must include at the end an academic integrity declaration. This should be a brief paragraph where you state
\emph{in your own words}  (1) whether you did the homework individually or in collaboration with a partner student (if so, provide the name), 
and (2) whether you used any external help or resources. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\vskip 0.1in
\paragraph{Submission.}
To submit the homework, you need to upload the pdf and cpp files to Gradescope. If you submit with a partner, you need
to put two names on the assignment and submit it as a group assignment.

\paragraph{Reminders.}
Remember that only {\LaTeX} papers are accepted.
