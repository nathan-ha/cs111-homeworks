% problem 1
\begin{problem} \\
	\noindent a) Consider the following linear homogeneous recurrence relation: $R_n = 4R_{n-1} - 3R_{n-2}$. It is known that: $R_0 = 1$, $R_2 = 5$. Find $R_3$.

	\vspace {0.1in}
	\noindent b) Determine the general solution of the recurrence  equation if its characteristic equation has the following roots:  1, -2, -2, 2, 7, 7.

	\vspace {0.1in}
	\noindent  c) Determine the general solution of the recurrence  equation $A_n = 256A_{n-4}$.

	\vspace {0.1in}
	\noindent  d) Find the general form of the particular solution of the recurrence $B_n = 3B_{n-2} - 2B_{n-3}$ + 2.

% solution 1
\begin{solution} \\
	\noindent a) 
		This linear recurrence has a characteristic equation of $x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$. This can be factored into $(x-3)(x-1) = 0 \implies x = 1, 3$.
\end{solution}
